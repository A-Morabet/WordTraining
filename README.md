## Summary

Word Training is a mobile application made with the purpose of helping people develop their day-to-day english vocabulary in an engaging way.
Project started around first-half of 2022, work was done a few hours on the weekends, then during the first-half of 2023 I picked up the pace
and was able to complete the app during summer.
App was made in the Unity Environment, more than 15.000 lines of C# code were written to define the App's logic, front-end and back-end aspects.

During the App session the user is presented with a small television on the upper-right corner with a hangman section below it; the television shows
the image of the item that the user must recognise and then hit the props containing the letters that form the item's word in any order until 
he completes the word, he then is rewarded with additional points and the next word is presented shortly after.</br><div align="middle"><a href="https://aminemorabet.com/vids/portfolio-02.mp4#t=0.1" target="__blank" align="middle">Video Demonstration</a></div></br>

In the App, the user can:

- Choose from three different vocabulary themes related to the house: Bedroom, Bathroom and Kitchen.
- Select from three levels of Word Difficulty which sets the level of frequency of the words being presented...etc.
- Adjust a series of options in the Options Menu such as 
- Fee amount.
- Patient's first name.

It will then proceed to create a list of dates that respect the
conditions given by the user. The calendar is then rendered
on a table alongside the patient's name, fees and total amount.
Both calendar and table can be toggled off and the invoice can 
also be printed with hidden buttons through the "Print Invoice" button.
